This repository contains the Matlab code for the paper Pederzoli, L., Bilucaglia, M., Prati, E., Matteoli, M., & Tressoldi, P. (2020, May 12). Modern Thoughtography: Mind Interaction at a distance with digital camera sensors: a pilot study. https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/edpt5 <https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/edpt5>. 

PsyCam is a GUI (Graphica User Interface) to load raw image files (in *.DNG format), compute the binning and extract several metrics (both at "single image" and "paired image" levels).

The "Matlab Files" folder contains the required files (*.m, *.mat and *.mlapp format) to execute PsyCam within the Matlab enviroment, while the "Compiled Files" folder contains the compiled version (*.exe format) to execute PsyCam as stand-alone software. Please note that in order to execute PsyCam within the Matlab Enviroment you must add the "Matlab Files" folder to the path, while to execute PsyCam as stand-alone software you must install the MRC (Matlab Runtime Compiler).

The "Instruction" folder contain instruction documents (*.pdf format) to both convert any raw image to *.DNG format (instruction_conversion.pdf) ant to run PsyCam (instruction_PsyCam).
